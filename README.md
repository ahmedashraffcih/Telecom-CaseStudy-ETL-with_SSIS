# Telecom-CaseStudy-ETL-with_SSIS
This is an educational project that uses fake data related to the field of communication (such as IMSI / IMEI / TAC / SNR), but I would like to highlight this project that reviews concepts and topics that can be applied in any other project, and the part of the field of Tele-communication in this series is very limited.

_The idea for this project is inspired by a series on Garage Education, in which Eng. Mostafa Alaa shows the process of building an ETL project using Scala._

## Project Tasks
- Read, process and transfer data directly. Simple ETL package.
- Dealing with data that do not meet the quality requirements specified in the project file bad data and error handling.
- Handle files stored in a specific folder "looping through files".
- Archive files that are moving processed.
- Auditing of processed data.
